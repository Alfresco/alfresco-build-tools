name: Delete Github Deployments

description: Delete gitHub deployments.Used as workaround to delete the flood of messages added to PRs when we run a workflow with a matrix that have the field environment set in the job.
  In this case a new comment is added in PR for every entry of the matrix.

inputs:
  branch-name:
    description: The name of the branch associated with pull request.
    required: true
